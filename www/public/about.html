    <p>Description</p>
    <p><em>Louis Pasteur</em> was a French chemist and microbiologist renowned for his discoveries of the principles of vaccination, microbial fermentation and pasteurization.<br>
       He is remembered for his remarkable breakthroughs in the <em>causes and preventions of diseases</em>, and his discoveries have saved countless lives ever since. He reduced mortality from puerperal fever, and created the first vaccines for rabies and anthrax.
       <br>His medical discoveries provided direct support for the germ theory of disease and its application in clinical medicine.<br>
       He is best known to the general public for his invention of the technique of treating milk and wine to stop bacterial contamination, a process now called pasteurization.<br>
       He is regarded as one of the three main founders of bacteriology, together with Ferdinand Cohn and Robert Koch, and is popularly known as the "father of microbiology".</p><hr>
